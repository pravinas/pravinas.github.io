Things I gotta do _today_:
- Finish my EC720 Homework (due tonight)
- Finish my CS599 Project (due tonight)
- Work on my EC720 Project (due Thursday)

Things I'm actually doing today:
- Melting down due to the Cambridge Classic 5k right outside my apartment.
- Going to a cafe with my girlfriend to avoid the noise of the aforementioned 5k.
- Practicing art technique with drawabox.

Every time I think about doing critical-path work I freeze. I hate this. I suck.

Oh right, and the depression's been a bitch. I wish I had any programming ability.

I just want to sleep.
