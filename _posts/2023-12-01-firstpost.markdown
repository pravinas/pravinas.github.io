Welcome to my blog! I'm Pravi, PR4v1, pravinas, RobotNerd, or whatever else you want to call me. I am a first year PhD student at Boston University, studying robotics under [Dr. Sabrina Neuman](https://sites.bu.edu/robomorphic/). I hope that I make your day a little bit brighter, and a whole lot weirder.

I grapple with a lot of things, personal and professional, and I hope that by starting this blog, I'm going to get a little bit of that out of my system. I can write some things as stream-of-consciousness journal entries (like this), some things as abstract creative works, some things as academic musings, or what have you. I tend to be fairly opinionated, but I recognize that my feelings may not be shared by everyone. While I do intend to post robo-nerdery every so often, and am probably going to keep an updated CV here for bragging rights, I think I more-or-less intend to be fairly relaxed in what I publish to this platform.

That being said, if I hurt or offend you in any way, please please let me know. My email should be linked in the header or footer of this page unless I've really screwed up the layout of this site. Also, I love to talk about myself, so if you have any questions about me or my interests, ask away! I haven't yet set up comments, but it's on the eventual to-do list.
