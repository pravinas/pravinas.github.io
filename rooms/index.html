      <h3>Rooms</h3>
      <p>This is an art project I started on 29 November 2023. I'm not entirely sure what emotions I'm trying to express here. I'll accompany art posts with explanations as well.</p>

        <h3>A Room That Envies You</h3>
        <img class="room" src="Rooms_Envies.png" alt="A Room That Envies You" />
        <p>When you take your place among the greats, The Room That Envies You needs itself to be the place that you take. It seeks to absorb you, to break you down and keep every part of you for itself. It is an endless tunnel, a spiraling path that disorients your unblemished mind. It envies your reason, your strength, your mobility. It envies your surety as you take each step into the world. And through its avarice, it will destroy that which it holds in esteem.</p>

        <h3>A Room That Wants You</h3>
        <img class="room" src="Rooms_Wants.png" alt="A Room That Wants You" />
        <p>The Room That Wants You is a well-lit and cozy space. You can see the sun rise from your desk as you wile away the time on your computer. The room bears no hostility towards you, no malice, just friendship and trust. It likes you, and it wants you to like it too. It wants you to stay here for a while. It wants you to live freely and happily.</p>
