### A Room That Envies You

When you take your place among the greats, The Room That Envies You needs itself to be the place that you take. It seeks to absorb you, to break you down and keep every part of you for itself. It is an endless tunnel, a spiraling path that disorients your unblemished mind. It envies your reason, your strength, your mobility. It envies your surety as you take each step into the world. And through its avarice, it will destroy that which it holds in esteem.
