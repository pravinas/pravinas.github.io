This room is reaching for you as you walk by. It feels you and touches you and grabs you. As you move away from the room, its tendrils ooze out towards you. It Needs You. You are part of it, you *must* be part of it. By denying it any part of yourself, you reject the room, hurting it, killing it. It only wants to survive. It only wants you for its survival.
