### A Room That Hates You

Loathing and malice accompanies your every footfall as you tread into this cold and seething room. It pulls away from you, it rushes towards you. It takes advantage of every second that you spend here to hurt and disorient you. This is not a place that seeks to provide you comfort, protection, or warmth. This is a place that would kill you slowly, torturously, painfully, if only it had the opportunity.
