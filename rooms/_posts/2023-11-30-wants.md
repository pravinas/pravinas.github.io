The Room That Wants You is a well-lit and cozy space. You can see the sun rise from your desk as you wile away the time on your computer. The room bears no hostility towards you, no malice, just friendship and trust. It likes you, and it wants you to like it too. It wants you to stay here for a while. It wants you to live freely and happily.
